## 🙌 Project Personal Milestones

- Authenticated and posted using **Twitter (X)’s API** with Tweepy Python library. Learned how to use it’s classes and methods, as well as **handling exceptions**.
- Web Scraping using **Selenium** (automated web testing tool), used its classes and methods. Handled Selenium exceptions that involved not finding an element.

## 💡 Inspiration for creating this project

I’m currently enrolled in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Udemy) and this is the course’s #51th project. 

The original project proposed logging in and posting by clicking on Twitter’s website using Selenium, but I found Twitter’s website HTML classes quite hard to manipulate with Selenium. Therefore, I chose to post by using the API instead and learned a bit more in the process.
